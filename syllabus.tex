\subsection*{Learning Objectives}

The emergence of generative AI has been reshaping financial workflows and careers. This course prepares MBA students to leverage AI for financial analysis.  The course is organized around the folowing principles:

What you will learn:
\begin{enumerate}
\item How to work with AI to do financial analysis
\item How custom chatbots and AI agents work 
\item How to work with AI to build custom chatbots and AI agents for financial analysis
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item Item \#1 is essential today 
\item Item \#2 is valuable today
\item The purpose of  \#3 is
\begin{itemize}
\item More practice on  \#1
\item A deeper understanding of  \#2
\item You could end up at a small firm and be the AI expert
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{AI Tool}

We are going to use Anthropic's Claude for the course.  Claude Opus and Sonnet are the best coding LLMs.  Also, Anthropic recently released Excel integration, so Claude can generate fully functioning, nicely formatted Excel workbooks. In addition, Anthropic created the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and has recently made it simpler for users to configure MCP connections in Claude Desktop.  Finally, we will use Claude Code, which is a very powerful coding agent.

\subsection*{Evaluation}

Grades will be based on four elements (25\% each).  The first three are \textbf{group projects}.

\begin{enumerate}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item AI cost of capital exercise: calculation, visualization, report generation 
\item  Cost of capital app 
\item Valuation chatbot
\item Seated exam with AI allowed 
\end{enumerate}
For each of the group projects, the deliverables are:
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item A chat/app/agent
\item A two-page Word doc explaining development and use
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Honor Code}
The Rice University honor code applies to all work in this course. Use of generative AI is of course permitted.

\subsubsection*{Disability Accommodations}
Any student with a documented disability requiring accommodations in this course is encouraged to contact me outside of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Any adjustments or accommodations regarding assignments or the final exam must be made in advance. Students with disabilities should also contact Disability Support Services in the Allen Center.
