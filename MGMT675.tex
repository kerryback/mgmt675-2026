\subsection*{Course Overview}

The emergence of generative AI has been reshaping financial workflows and careers. This course prepares MBA students to leverage AI in financial modeling, valuation analysis, and app development. Students will develop hands-on fluency in combining Python, AI assistants, and custom applications to deliver financial insights.  By the end of the course, students will:

\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Use AI in combination with Python for simulation, forecasting, and portfolio optimization
\item Build AI-enabled apps for data retrieval, visualization, and automated reporting
\item Design a custom financial chatbot for financial statement analysis and valuation
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Evaluation}

Grades will be based on three group projects, each weighted equally:
\begin{enumerate}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item AI + Python Portfolio Optimization Exercise 
\item AI-Powered Stock Screener App 
\item AI Statement Analysis and Valuation Chatbot 
\end{enumerate}
Each project deliverable includes:
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item A working notebook/app/chatbot prototype
\item A short presentation explaining design choices, AI integration, and financial insights
\end{itemize}
